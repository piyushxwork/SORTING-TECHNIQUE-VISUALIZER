# SORTING TECHNIQUE VISUALIZER

Simple visualizer for sorting algorithms.

Files
- `Sorting-Visualizer-master/art.css`
- `Sorting-Visualizer-master/index.html`
- `Sorting-Visualizer-master/style.js`

How to run
- Open `Sorting-Visualizer-master/index.html` in a browser (double-click).
- Or serve the folder with a local HTTP server, for example:

  ```powershell
  cd "Sorting-Visualizer-master\Sorting-Visualizer-master"
  python -m http.server 8000
  ```

Notes
- The project files are currently inside the `Sorting-Visualizer-master` subfolder in the repository root. If you want them at the repo root, I can move them and commit that change.
- I added a brief README and pushed it to `main`.

If you want a different README text or a `.gitignore` / `.gitattributes`, tell me and I'll add it.
